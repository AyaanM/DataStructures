	<p>Welcome to the <b>Nodes</b> page</p>

	<p>On the page we will be descussing how <b>Nodes</b> work</p>
	<p>Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of many computer science data structures. They form the basis for linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more.</p>
	<p>An individual <b>Node</b> contains data and a link to another node</p>
	<p>The data inside of <b>Nodes</b> can either be a string, an integer, a float, an array, or null</p>
	<p>Use this image of a singular node as an example. <code class='data_names'>node_a</code> contains the data as the integer 5, and it also contains a link to <code class='data_names'>node_b</code></b> </p>
	<br>
	<p>The links inside of a node can be called a pointer since it points to a node. When there are many <b>nodes</b>, a <b>LinkedList</b> is formed.</p>
	<p>A <b>LinkedList</b> can contain of many nodes linked to each other. If there is no link <code class='data_names'>null</code> in a <b>node</b> then we have reached the end of our <b>Linked List</b> or the particular path we were following</p>
	<p>Take the picture of linked list as example. Here there are many nodes and they link to many different nodes. If we were to track the path of <code class='data_names'>node_a</code> that would lead us to <code class='data_names'>node_b</code> but because <code class='data_names'>node_b</code> does not link to a node the path ends</p>
