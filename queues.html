	<p>A queue is a data structure which contains an ordered set of data</p>
	<p>Queues provide 3 methods of interaction:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Enqueue - adds data to the “back” or end of the queue</li>
		<li>Dequeue - provides and removes data from the “front” or beginning of the queue</li>
		<li>Peek - reveals data from the “front” of the queue without removing it</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>A queue also can also be seen as a line to get tickets. In the Enque image, a person is being <code class='data_names'>enqued</code> in the line. In peek a person is being <code class='data_names'>peeked</code> at. In pop, a person is being <code class='data_names'>dequed</code> off the line</p>
	<br>
	<p>Just like stacks, queues can be implemented using a linked list as the underlying data structure because it’s more efficient than a list or array.</p>
	<p>In this image we can compare queues and linked lists and see how the 3 people or 3 nodes contain data and link to the next people or node</p>
