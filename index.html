	<p>Hi this is Ayaan Merchant</p>
	<p>In these series of webpages we will be showing how different Data Structures work</p>
	<p>These several data structures can be implemented using many diffrent programming languages</p>
	<br>
	<p>The data structures we will be going through today are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href='nodes.html'>Nodes</a></li>
		<li><a href='stacks.html'>Stacks</a></li>
		<li><a href='queues.html'>Queues</a></li>
		<li><a href='heaps.html'>Heaps</a></li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p><b><i>Please Note:</i></b> There are many more data structures that can be implemented with programming languages these are just a few</p>
	<p>On another note, we will not be showcasing how these data structures are implemented using programming languages, we will be giving an overview of what each of these data structures do</p>
