	<p>Welcome to the <b>Heaps</b> page. This page will give a breif overview of heaps</p>
	<p>Heaps are used to maintain a maximum or minimum value in a dataset.</p>
	<p>Heaps are basically trees which keep track of certain things. Heaps also have functions heapify up and heapify down, which add and remove objects from heaps. But will not be discussed on this webpage</p>
	<p>Think of the min-heap as a binary tree with two qualities:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The root is the minimum value of the dataset.</li>
		<li>Every child’s value is greater than its parent</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This image shows these incorporated values</p>

	<br>
	<p>We can picture min-heaps as binary trees, where each node has at most two children. As we add elements to the heap, they’re added from left to right until we’ve filled the entire level.</p>
	<p>This picture compares heaps and binary trees</p>
